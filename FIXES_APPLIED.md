# Code Fixes Applied

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Vulnerability - FIXED
**File:** `server.js`
**Issue:** User data was directly injected into HTML without escaping, allowing potential XSS attacks.
**Fix:** Added `escapeHtml()` function to sanitize all user input before displaying in HTML.

### 2. ✅ Missing Input Validation - FIXED
**File:** `userRoutes.js`
**Issues:**
- No validation for required fields
- No email format validation
- No password length validation

**Fixes:**
- Added validation for email and password in both register and login routes
- Added email format validation using regex
- Added minimum password length check (3 characters)
- Added validation for firstname and lastname in registration

### 3. ✅ Security Issue - Password Exposure - FIXED
**File:** `userRoutes.js`
**Issue:** Passwords were being returned in API responses.
**Fix:** Added `.select('-password')` to exclude passwords from user list responses.

### 4. ✅ Missing Error Handling - FIXED
**Files:** `userRoutes.js`, `server.js`, `public/login.html`
**Issues:**
- Missing console.error for debugging
- No JSON parse error handling
- Missing error message fallbacks

**Fixes:**
- Added console.error for all catch blocks
- Added try-catch for JSON parsing in login.html
- Added fallback error messages

### 5. ✅ Missing Input Validation in Frontend - FIXED
**File:** `public/login.html`
**Issue:** No client-side validation before sending requests.
**Fix:** Added validation checks for required fields before API calls.

### 6. ✅ Date Handling - FIXED
**File:** `server.js`
**Issue:** Potential error if createdAt is null/undefined.
**Fix:** Added null check before formatting date.

## Security Improvements:

1. **XSS Protection:** All user data is now escaped before display
2. **Input Validation:** Both client and server-side validation
3. **Password Security:** Passwords excluded from API responses
4. **Error Handling:** Better error messages without exposing sensitive info

## Code Quality Improvements:

1. **Better Error Logging:** Added console.error for debugging
2. **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Defensive Programming:** Added null checks and fallbacks

## Testing Recommendations:

1. Test with malicious input (XSS attempts)
2. Test with invalid email formats
3. Test with missing required fields
4. Test with very long inputs
5. Verify passwords are not returned in API responses
